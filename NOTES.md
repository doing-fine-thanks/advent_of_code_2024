# Notes:

This is a place to jot down thoughs. Will do my best to keep a log every day I do the AOC challenges.

## Day 1

Ultimately a nice time solving the first day. For the most part Odin felt pretty natural.
The only thing that really surprised me was the use of old-school function names like "atoi."

The other thing I have to get used to is the package namespacing. That style of path-prefixing is so 
strongly tied to OOP stuff for me that it is kind of hard to have it feel natural or "right" here. 
Not that it is bad; just unfamiliar. 

Overall, nice time.
