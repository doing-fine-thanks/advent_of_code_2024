# Advent of Code 2024

This is a little zone for me to put both my [Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com) solutions somewhere
and also take notes about trying [Odin](https://odin-lang.org). I have messed around with Odin here and there,
but I have would like to do a little more directed usage of it.

## Repo Layout:

- `src/` : Here are the solutions, each file name signifying the day it solves. Each part of each day is in a single file.
- `puzzle_input`: each days input saved as a `.txt` file. - This is private, so sorry.
- `puzzle_desc`: descriptions of each puzzle for offline usage. - Again private, so sorry.
- `tempaltes` : a boilerplate file for me to get a basic `.odin` file up and running.
- `run.sh`: runs each odin file in sequence from day_1 to day_25.

## Why Not Post the Puzzle Desciption and Inputs:

[Because the creator asked us not to](https://adventofcode.com/about#faq_copying).
